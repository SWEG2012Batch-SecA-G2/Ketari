## Background
> A job application portal is a modern name for an online job board that helps the employers to find their candidates and also helps the job seekers to find the jobs which are suitable for them. These online job portals offer a wide range of access in different  areas. The government agencies, non profit organizations, universities and private businesses have created online job  portals to enable the job seekers to access the organizations website. Although it might not fully satisfy the job seekers and the job posters completely.  Normally many companies waste their money and valuable time when finding the right candidates for the jobs. Although some sites provide specific information about CVs and how to write them, they perform better in interviews and the topics preferred by the job seeker, the face difficulties in achieving the communication and interactions between the job seekers and the job posters. 

<br>

> In the current scenario, there is a rat race in each and every professional field. It is also true for the job market. A job searching portal is a website dedicated for online information about recruiters as well as job seekers. The job searching web app helps both the job seekers and recruiters finding the right organization for the employees. This Job Searching portal aims to help job seekers what jobs are available to apply. This system allows candidates to complete online job applications and upload their updated resume.

<br>

> The intention of Job searching web application is facilitating both the candidates seeking jobs as well as the employers looking for employees for their companies. In this online application, any job seeker can search for the available jobs at any moment with updated information. When he finds a job, he can post his application to the job online. Employers can advertise the vacancies by taking the membership, logging in and posting the job information with the eligibility criteria for the jobs. This software establishes a direct connection between the employer and the job seeker. A job seeker can directly visit this portal and view the jobs availability information along with downloading the required information. When he logs into the system, he would be able to upload his application and post walk-in details which he knows would be held by a company. This information helps other users very much to attend the same. Further, the user will be able to view the list of companies for which he has already applied. This enables him to make a decision when he gets a call from a company and how much time elapsed since he has applied for the company.

<br>

## Motivation
> The motivation for designing this job searching web application is to solve the problems that still exist in our country due to its paper-based job posting and hiring procedures. Anyone who has looked for a job can tell us that it is hard work. Searching for relevant positions, updating resume, applying for jobs, writing cover letters, and interviewing take a large amount of time and effort to complete. One of the most time-consuming and draining aspects of job searching is finding relevant job postings. This often entails frequenting online job boards, scanning for relevant job titles, reading the job’s description, and identifying whether or not this job posting is relevant to our qualifications. Because much of this data is available online, this task is ripe for some automation. So we have chosen to tackle this problem to contribute for the betterment of the job posting and hiring trends in our country.

<br>

## Purpose
> The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of Job searching web application. It will explain the purpose and features as well as interfaces of the system, what the system will do, the constraints under which it must operate and how the system will react to external stimuli. This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system.

<br> 

## Statement of the Problem
> There are many problems with the traditional job searching and application systems. The organization and availability of job opening posts, standard CV documentation and long waiting hours around billboards.
Our team has an ideal view of such a world where job searching is easy. We want to solve the problems listed below: 
* The time and energy wasted around billboard areas for an uncertain opportunity. This happens a lot and it discourages job seekers which in turn creates less working force.
* The billboards use too much paperwork and other resources. It also wastes the country’s infrastructure.
* An unstandardized CV application creates ambiguity between the applicant and the employer over the qualification of an applicant for a position.

To solve this problems, we propose:
* An online billboard and a timeline where all job seekers could get notified of job opportunities.
* A form with a standardized questionnaire for the job applicants that would generate a well-organized CV which can be accepted by all.
* A platform where employers can post job openings and get a list of all qualified applicants to choose from.
Objectives

## General Objective
> The main objective of the project is to change the manual way of operation of the job application to an automatic system. This system will help to reduce the time required during the job search process.it will help the employees and the employers to reduce the human resources needed in a company. The job portal also provides flexibility to the job seekers.

<br> 

> It aims to develop a system in which job applicants and recruiters can communicate with each other and find suitable employment and employees for all interested parties. The job searching web application strives to simplify the communication between the job seekers with the major agencies by providing fast, easy, and user-friendly communication channel.

### Specific Objective
This paper aims to develop a web application that will allow the employer companies to share relevant data and information with job aspirants, as well as to make available information on online-recruitment. The objectives of this project are:
1) To design, implement and develop a web portal as a knowledge management system.
2) To identify the needs of the companies and job seekers which will be incorporated in to a knowledge management system with updated information
3) To understand the meaning, features and categories of web portals for the system
4) To design an online recruitment system that allows employers to post their job advertisements, which job seekers can refer to, when looking for jobs.
5) To develop and evaluate the job searching web application
6) Testing and implementation of the system

## Methods
> In our project we will be using Agile project management methodology as it includes requirements discovery, solutions improvement through collaborative efforts of our team members with our end users, adaptive planning to reiterate our plans to the most efficient as we go along, evolutionary development, continual improvements, flexible responses to changes in requirements and early delivery since we are confined to a limited amount of time to deliver our product. 

To make the most of our time and effort in producing an efficient and requirement fulfilling product we are planning to take the following agile methodology project management steps:

#### Project Planning
> Like with all projects our team should understand the end goal and how it will be achieved. And we have done that as we were brainstorming ideas for the project. We agreed that our end goal is to help decrease unemployment of graduating students and other job seekers by providing a simple and easy to use but highly effective job searching platform.

#### Product Roadmap Creation 
> A roadmap is a breakdown of the features that will make up the final product. This crucial component of the planning stage of Agile has been thought of and figured out by our team as we were writing functional and nonfunctional requirements. 

#### Release Planning
> Our project uses shorter development cycles called sprints with features released at the end of each cycle. We think this is better because it helps us build up our feature-set gradually until eventually we have a feature rich and functional product to show off.

#### Sprint Planning
> Before each sprint begins, we will hold a sprint meeting to determine what will be accomplished by each person during that sprint, how it will be achieved, and assess the task load. 

#### Routine Stand-ups
> We hold short weekly stand-ups in our team during which we assess whether any changes need to be made and to check how everyone is getting along in their progress and workload.

#### Sprint review and retrospective 
> After the end of each sprint we will have a sprint retrospective meeting with each other to discuss what went well during the sprint, what could have been better, whether the task load was too heavy or too light for each member, and what was accomplished during the sprint. This will help us figure out how much our team can tackle during each sprint hence improving our sprint planning for the next sprint.

## Scope and limitations
* When building a system there are certain things that we have to keep in mind, one of them being the feasibility of the planned project.
> Whether we, the developers, can be able to meet the objectives we have set for ourselves. 

* In normal proceedings of building a system and understanding the limitations present, one of the first factors to consider would be the economic limits. 
> This includes issues of budget and other subjects related to funding. Its aim is to be able to fairly predict the returns of the system to ensure some level of confidence when directing funds towards the project. This being a learning opportunity devoid of any necessary expense in direct relation to the project, our main limitation would fall onto two key areas, schedule limitations and technical limitations.

* Schedule limitations that may be encountered during the making of this project include the high chances of overlapping projects. 
> The short time period given to complete the project and the vastness of information that needs to be gathered could cause some difficulties. And due to the project being side to side with the learning, that will cause some limitations as well. Technical difficulties include the ability or inability of members -as students learning through the process- to solve certain issues that might arise. But this is a welcome issue since it is part of the learning process. There is also the challenge to encounter when looking for appropriate source materials due to the shortage of accurate digital data of the topic at hand. Despite the aforementioned points we plan on putting our best efforts in this project and meet our objectives with flying colors. 


## Functional requirements 

1. The System must allow job-seekers and recruiters to sign up using an email and password.
> Job-seekers will use their email accounts to sign in to our platform and look for opportunities while recruiters sign in and post opportunities.
2. The System must allow job seekers to fill out a form and generate a CV and Resume from the form
> The platform will make job seekers fill out a form asking different questions to generate a valid and reusable CV and Resume for them for free
3. The System must allow job seekers to filter out job opening using different filters
> Job seekers can filter out all available openings using different measurements so they can view customized and more relevant openings to apply to
4. The System must allow job seekers to read in depth of job opening descriptions 
> Recruiters and companies will be asked to write a detailed description of the kind of job to be performed and what kind of person they think will do that job adequately and this detailed information will be transparent to job seekers to evaluate themselves and the job to make sure they’re applying and being well informed in doing so.
5. The System must allow job seekers to apply for and withdraw from job openings 
> Job seekers should have the freedom to apply to any job they think will fit them and withdraw their application whenever possible. This will make our job seekers comfortable in applying to jobs and not feel like they’re imprisoned just because they applied.
6. The System must allow recruiters to filter job applications based on different filters
> Recruiters should have the ease of filtering out job applications by different measurements to go further with the recruitment process.
7. The System must allow job seekers to display an overview of their capacity and skills on their profiles 
> Job seekers can display basic information about themselves like their education, skills or past job experiences on their profile on their bio-like section 
8. The System must allow recruiters to post a picture or a text based format of their job opening
> Infographics are a great way to attract attention and focus. They’re also a great way to show how much a company gives attention to details which speaks a thousand words because job seekers will think that the company does things well and organized with care. Hence, the platform will allow companies and recruiters to post images announcing job openings
9. The System must make all recruitment pass through a verification process to provide trusted and legit job openings
> To eliminate and minimize the risk of displaying a fake or scam job opening we make recruiters verify themselves using their commercial and operating legal files and Identifications. And those who passed this will display a verified check mark right beside their profile name. This will allow the company or recruiter to post future openings with ease and trust. 
10. The System must allow logging out and deletion of accounts for both job seekers and recruiters
> If users get wary of using the platform or want a brand new start they can delete all data held by the system by deleting their account.
